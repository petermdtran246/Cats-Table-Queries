## Overview
This repository contains a simple SQL project that creates and manages a database table named `cats`. The table stores information about various cats, including their IDs, names, breeds, and ages. The project includes SQL commands to create the table, insert sample data, and perform basic queries to retrieve specific information. This is a beginner-friendly example to demonstrate fundamental SQL operations such as `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, 'WHERE' and `SELECT`.

## Features
- Create a `cats` table with columns: `cat_id`, `name`, `breed`, and `age`.
- Insert sample data for multiple cats.
- Perform various SQL queries to:
  - Retrieve all data from the table.
  - Extract specific columns (e.g., `cat_id`, `name`, `breed`).
  - Filter data using `WHERE` clauses with conditions (e.g., specific names and ages, or specific `cat_id` values)
